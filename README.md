This application allows the user to create a randomly generated password after deciding on several different criteria methods. Those include lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers and special characters. After deciding on the characters to be used, the user may specify the length from 8 characters to 128. With all specifications made, the user can click generate to create a random password. Besides this, the user may also click the copy button to copy the password directly to their clipboard.
